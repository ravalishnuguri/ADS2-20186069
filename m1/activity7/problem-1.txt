Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a way to rename the vertices of one to make it identical to the other. Draw all the non isomorphic graphs with two, three, four, and five vertices.

ANS)

Suppose we have two graphs. In the first graph there are v1
vertices and e1 edges. In the second graph there are v2 vertices
and e2 edges. Then in order for the two graphs to be isomorphic
we must have:
v1 = v2
e1 = e2
In words, isomorphic graphs must have the same number of
vertices and edges.
