Q)What is the maximum number of edges in a digraph with V vertices and no parallel edges? What is the minimum number of edges in a digraph with V vertices, none of which are isolated?

A)If you have N nodes, there are N - 1 directed edges than can lead from it (going to every other node). Therefore, the maximum number of edges is N * (N - 1) . In an undirected graph (excluding multigraphs), the answer is n*(n-1)/2.
